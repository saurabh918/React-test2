# Recipe Search Website

This is a React-based recipe search website where users can browse a selection of default food items, search for additional recipes, and bookmark their favorite ones for future reference. The application uses **React Redux Toolkit** for state management and **Styled Components** for styling.

## Features

- **Default Recipes**: Users are presented with a selection of default food items on the home page.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for additional recipes by entering keywords in the search bar.
- **Bookmark Recipes**: Users can bookmark their favorite recipes and access them later for future reference.
- **State Management**: The application uses **React Redux Toolkit** for handling state, managing searches, bookmarks, and UI states.
- **Styled Components**: Styling is handled using **Styled Components** to create dynamic, reusable styled components.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The main framework for building the user interface.
- **React Redux Toolkit**: Used for managing global state across the app (recipes, search results, bookmarks).
- **Styled Components**: Utilized for component-level styling with a scoped and dynamic styling approach.
- **Axios or Fetch API**: For making API calls to fetch recipe data.
